# How To Install
Download The Repo And Run The Folder Is VS Code, Idiot!
# How To Build
If You Don't Have HaxeFlixel Or The Required Package's Installed, Do The Following
1) Install [Haxe 4.1.5](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.1.5/) (Version 4.1.5 Is Recommended As Older/Newer Versions Can Be Unstable)
2) Install [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/) (Require's Haxe Installed To Install)
3) Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
4) Run The Following Commands:
- `haxelib install flixel`
- `haxelib install flixel-addons`
- `haxelib install flixel-ui`
- `haxelib install polymod`
- `haxelib git "https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_discord-rpc"`

Now You Have HaxeFlixel And The Required Packages:
- In The Repository, Run The Bat File For A Windows Build `compile-windows.bat`.

- I'll Get To Linux, HTML & Android (And Maybe Even Newground's) At Some Point.
